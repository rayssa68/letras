Mustard on the beat, ho!
I was good on my own, that's the way it was
That's the way it was
You was good on the low for a faded f-
On some faded love
Sh-, what the f- you complaining for?
Feeling jaded, huh?
Used to trip off that sh- I was kickin' to you
Had some fun on the run, though I'll give it to you
But baby, don't get it twisted
You was just another n- on the hit list
Tryna fix your inner issues with a bad b-
Didn't they tell you that I was a savage?
F- your white horse and a carriage
Bet you never could imagine
Never told you you could have it
You needed me
Ooh, you needed me
To feel a little more, and give a little less
Know you hate to confess
But baby, ooh, you needed me
You been rollin' around, sh- I'm rollin up
Light and roll it up
Break it down like a pound, sh- was never us
Sh- was never us
That's the real on the real, are you serious?
How you feel, how you feel?
Used to trip off that sh- I was kickin' to ya
Had some fun on the run, though I give it to ya
But baby, don't get it twisted (don't get)
You was just another n- on the hit list
Tryna fix your inner issues with a bad b-
Didn't they tell you that I was a savage?
F- your white horse and a carriage
Bet you never could imagine
Never told you you could have it
You needed me
Ooh (ooh), you needed me (you needed me)
To feel a little more, and give a little less (ooh)
Know you hate to confess
But baby, ooh, you needed me

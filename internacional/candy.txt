I can name a couple ways, baby, this shit might go
You just might forget that this was what you're gettin' hyped for
Late at night, do the things to him, mean that guy who
Need someone who's sweet enough, who'll shoot to make that high note
And it's such a typical thing
Runnin' over a billion men, ooh
Runnin' through a difficult place
You gon' meet a billion hands, ooh
She's just like candy, she's so sweet
But you know that it ain't real cherry
Know that it ain't real cherry
She's just like candy, she's so sweet
But you know that it ain't real
Know that it ain't real
I can be your sugar when you're fiendin' for that sweet spot
Put me in your mouth, baby, and eat it 'til your teeth rot
I can be your cherry, apple, pecan, or your key lime
Baby, I got everything and so much more than she's got
And it's such a typical thing
Runnin' over a billion men, ooh
Runnin' through a difficult place
You gon' meet a billion hands, ooh
She's just like candy, she's so sweet
But you know that it ain't real cherry
Know that it ain't real cherry
She's just like candy, she's so sweet
But you know that it ain't real
Know that it ain't real
She's just like candy, she's so sweet
But you know that it ain't real cherry
Know that it ain't real cherry
She's just like candy, she's so sweet
But you know that it ain't real
Know that it ain't real
Sugar coated, lies unfolded
You still lick the wrapper
It's addictive, you know this
But you still lick the wrapper
Sugar coated, lies unfolded
You still lick the wrapper
It's addictive, you know this
But you still lick the wrapper
She's just like candy, she's so sweet
But you know that it ain't real cherry
Know that it ain't real cherry
She's just like candy, she's so sweet
But you know that it ain't real
Know that it ain't real
She's just like candy, she's so sweet
But you know that it ain't real cherry
Know that it ain't real cherry
She's just like candy, she's so sweet
But you know that it ain't real
Know that it ain't real
